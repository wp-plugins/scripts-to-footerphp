This small plugin moves scripts to the footer to help speed up page load times, while keeping stylesheets in the header.

== Description ==

This small plugin moves scripts to the footer to help speed up page load times, while keeping stylesheets in the header. Note that this only works if you have plugins and a theme that utilizes `wp_enqueue_scripts` correctly.

Now includes an option to disable the plugin on a specific page.

Finally, if you're comfortable with code you can use the `scripts_to_footer_post_types` filter to change the post types this applies to (it only applies to pages and posts by default).
